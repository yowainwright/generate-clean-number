A JavaScript utility for removing anything that is not a number ([NaN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/NaN)) from a number.

There are situations, particularly with [Intl](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl) where numbers are generated with extra characters in certain browsers. Generate Clear Number is a few line utility that strips characters that are not numbers from it.

 üéâ **2.0.0:** Provides decimal support. This version should **not** cause breakage, however, because this update switches from returning [parseInt(string, 10)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/parseInt) to [parseFloat(num)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/parseFloat) `v2.0.0` was added for safety.

## Usage

Generate Clean Number provides 2 methods for generating a clean number (removing unwanted characters).

### `generateCleanNumber`

`generateCleanNumber` uses regex to remove unwanted characters from numbers. Just a ternary but may be less performant if many numbers are being trimmed.

```javascript

import {
  generateCleanNumber
} from 'generate-clean-number'

const nowCleanNumber = generateCleanNumber(<someNumber>)

```

### `filterNaNfromNumber`

`filterNaNfromNumber` turns a number into an array and strips non-number characters from it before returning a number.

```javascript

import {
  filterNaNfromNumber
} from 'generate-clean-number'

const nowCleanNumber = filterNaNfromNumber(<someNumber>)

```
